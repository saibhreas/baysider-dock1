  ## Purpose: 

  This project is directed by TM Media, it is to quote the source "This is a project based course where we build an extensive, in-depth backend API for DevCamper, a bootcamp directory app. We will start from scratch and end up with a professional deployed API with documentation."
  It's my sandbox to exhibit this model for Node Express  MongoDB side.  NPM installations will be done in pieces as the project develops.
  Annotation to the README will follow changes as prescribed by the course.
